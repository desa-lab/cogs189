# COGS 189: Brain-Computer Interfaces
This is a repository for all relevant, public-facing COGS 189 material. It's mostly a convenient place to aggregate all of the assignments that we've worked on over the past. It can be confusing to point people to assignments in any given year since sometimes we had assignments in only Python, only MATLAB, Python OR MATLAB, or Python AND MATLAB using SoS.
